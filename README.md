This is a practical part of a project created by Coursera Project Network.

### Key concepts
* What BERT is and what it can do
* Clean and preprocess text dataset
* Split dataset into training and validation sets using stratified approach
* Tokenize (encode) dataset using BERT toknizer
* Design BERT finetuning architecture
* Evaluate performance using F1 scores and accuracy
* Finetune BERT using training loop
